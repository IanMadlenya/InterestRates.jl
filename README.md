Tools for **Term Structure of Interest Rates** calculation, aimed at the valuation of financial contracts, specially *Fixed Income* instruments.

**Installation**: 
```julia
julia> Pkg.add("InterestRates")
```

## Concept

A Term Structure of Interest Rates, also known as *zero-coupon curve*, is a function `f(t) â†’ y` that maps a given maturity `t` onto the yield `y` of a bond that matures at `t` and pays no coupons (*zero-coupon bond*).

For instance, say the current price of a bond that pays exactly `10` in `1 year` is `9.25`. If one buys that bond for the current price and holds it until the maturity of the contract, that investor will gain `0.75`, which represents `8.11%` of the original price. That means that the bond is currently priced with a yield of `8.11%` *per year*.

It's not feasible to observe prices for each possible maturity. We can observe only a set of discrete data points of the yield curve. Therefore, in order to determine the entire term structure, one must choose an interpolation method, or a term structure model.

## Data Structure for Interest Rate Curve

All yield curve calculation is built around a *database-friendly* data type: `IRCurve`.

```julia
type IRCurve <: AbstractIRCurve
	name::ASCIIString
	daycount::DayCountConvention
	compounding::CompoundingType
	method::CurveMethod
	date::Date
	dtm::Vector{Int} # for interpolation methods, stores days_to_maturity on curve's daycount convention.
	zero_rates::Vector{Float64} # for interpolation methods, parameters[i] stores yield for maturity dtm[i].
	parameters::Vector{Float64} # for parametric methods, parameters stores model's constant parameters.
	dict::Dict{Symbol, Any}		# holds pre-calculated values for optimization, or additional parameters.
#...
```

The type `DayCountConvention` sets the convention on how to count the number of days between dates, and also how to convert that number of days into a year fraction.

Given an initial date `D1` and a final date `D2`, here's how the distance between `D1` and `D2` are mapped into a year fraction for each supported day count convention:

* *Actual360* : `(D2 - D1) / 360`
* *Actual365* : `(D2 - D1) / 365`
* *BDays252* : `bdays(D1, D2) / 252`, where `bdays` is the business days between `D1` and `D2` from `BusinessDays.jl` package.

The type `CompoundingType` sets the convention on how to convert a yield into an Effective Rate Factor.

Given a yield `r` and a maturity year fraction `t`, here's how each supported compounding type maps the yield to Effective Rate Factors:

* *ContinuousCompounding* : `exp(r*t)`
* *SimpleCompounding* : `(1+r*t)`
* *ExponentialCompounding* : `(1+r)^t`

The `date` field sets the date when the Yield Curve is observed. All zero rate calculation will be performed based on this date.

The fields `dtm` and `zero_rates` hold the observed market data for the yield curve, as discussed on *Curve Methods* section.

The field `parameters` holds parameter values for term structure models, as discussed on *Curve Methods* section.

`dict` is avaliable for additional parameters, and to hold pre-calculated values for optimization.

## Curve Methods

This package provides the following curve methods.

**Interpolation Methods**

* **Linear**: provides Linear Interpolation on rates.
* **FlatForward**: provides Flat Forward interpolation, which is implemented as a Linear Interpolation on the *log* of discount factors.
* **StepFunction**: creates a step function around given data points.
* **CubicSplineOnRates**: provides *natural cubic spline* interpolation on rates.
* **CubicSplineOnDiscountFactors**: provides *natural cubic spline* interpolation on discount factors.
* **CompositeInterpolation**: provides support for different interpolation methods for: (1) extrapolation before first data point (`before_first`), (2) interpolation between the first and last point (`inner`), (3) extrapolation after last data point (`after_last`).

For *Interpolation Methods*, the field `dtm` holds the number of days between `date` and the maturity of the observed yield, following the curve's day count convention, which must be given in advance, when creating an instance of the curve. The field `zero_rates` holds the yield values for each maturity provided in `dtm`. All yields must be anual based, and must also be given in advance, when creating the instance of the curve.

**Term Structure Models**

* **NelsonSiegel**: term structure model based on *Nelson, C.R., and A.F. Siegel (1987), Parsimonious Modeling of Yield Curve, The Journal of Business, 60, 473-489*.
* **Svensson**: term structure model based on *Svensson, L.E. (1994), Estimating and Interpreting Forward Interest Rates: Sweden 1992-1994, IMF Working Paper, WP/94/114*.

For *Term Structure Models*, the field `parameters` holds the constants defined by each model, as described below. They must be given in advance, when creating the instance of the curve.

For **NelsonSiegel** method, the array `parameters` holds the following parameters from the model:
* **beta1** = parameters[1]
* **beta2** = parameters[2]
* **beta3** = parameters[3]
* **lambda** = parameters[4]

For **Svensson** method, the array `parameters` hold the following parameters from the model:
* **beta1** = parameters[1]
* **beta2** = parameters[2]
* **beta3** = parameters[3]
* **beta4** = parameters[4]
* **lambda1** = parameters[5]
* **lambda2** = parameters[6]

## Usage

```julia
using InterestRates

# First, create a curve instance.

vert_x = [11, 15, 50, 80] # for interpolation methods, represents the days to maturity
vert_y = [0.10, 0.15, 0.14, 0.17] # yield values

dt_curve = Date(2015,08,03)

mycurve = InterestRates.IRCurve("dummy-simple-linear", InterestRates.Actual365(),
	InterestRates.SimpleCompounding(), InterestRates.Linear(), dt_curve,
	vert_x, vert_y)

# yield for a given maturity date
y = zero_rate(mycurve, Date(2015,08,25))
# 0.148

# forward rate between two future dates
fy = forward_rate(mycurve, Date(2015,08,25), Date(2015, 10, 10))
# 0.16134333771591897

# Discount factor for a given maturity date
df = discountfactor(mycurve, Date(2015,10,10))
# 0.9714060637029466

# Effective Rate Factor for a given maturity
erf = ERF(mycurve, Date(2015,10,10))
# 1.0294356164383562

# Effective Rate for a given maturity
er = ER(mycurve, Date(2015,10,10))
# 0.029435616438356238
